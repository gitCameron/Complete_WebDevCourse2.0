# README

This repository is for the sole purpose of storing project(s) from a web developer course.  
The course covers topics such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Wordpress, PHP, MySQL, APIs, and Python.

## CodePlayer (JQuery)
This app is a live pastebin for HTML, CSS & JavaScript only.

## My Rental Property App (Bootstrap)
Basic app for property management.  Some functionality still needed but this gave me good practice.  I may continue to work on it in the future.
